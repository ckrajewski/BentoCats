# Bento Coding Challenge By Chris Krajewski

## Contribution

If you like to help and contribute (there's lot root for improvements! I've collected a list of [Improvements and New Features](#improvements) you're more than welcome! 

## Install and run

First clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/ckrajewski/BentoCats
```

Open a terminal and cd into the `BentoCats` folder. Then:

1. `npm install` (installs the node modules and the TypeScript definition files)
2. `npm start` 

Your default browser should automatically open and redirect you to `http://localhost:8080`
It may open the tab before everything is loaded, but that's OK. After waiting for a bit, it should load :)

## Looking at the code

To take a close look at the front end code (React) feel free to use any text editor i.e. Sublime/Atom. Here's not the time to argue which is better :) 

## Feedback
In case you have any comments, questions, bugs, enhancements feel free to open an issue in this repository.

# New Features
