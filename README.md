# Bento Coding Challenge By Chris Krajewski

## Contribution

I've collected a list of [Improvements and New Features](#improvements) that need to be done.
If you'd like to help by contributing to the project, you're more than welcome to! 

## Install and run

First clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/ckrajewski/BentoCats
```

Open a terminal and cd into the `BentoCats` folder. Then:

1. `npm install` (installs the node modules and the TypeScript definition files)
2. `npm start` 

Your default browser should automatically open and redirect you to `http://localhost:8080`
It may open the tab before everything is loaded, but that's OK. After waiting for a bit, it should load :)

## Looking at the code

To take a close look at the front end code (React) feel free to use any text editor i.e. Sublime/Atom. Here's not the time to argue which is better :) 

## Feedback
In case you have any comments, questions, bugs, enhancements feel free to open an issue in this repository.

# Improvements
- [ ] Add client-side testing (Jest)
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Add ESLint
- [ ] Add TypeScript
- [ ] Look into PostCSS. Has lots of packages (like adding namespacing to stylized components)
- [ ] Seperate webpack into dev and prod configs
- [ ] Add better styling support for smaller sized images and gifs
- [ ] Get client feedback on UI. e.g. header colors could be less ugly :/ 

# New Features 
- [ ] Add infinite scrolling support in API Layer as well as in the front-end (in React)
- [ ] Add stenciling to show that resources (like images) are being loaded
